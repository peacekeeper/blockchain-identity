Data collected to establish a self-sovereign identity is not stored on any central server. Instead, the data is passed to the verifier (be it a machine or a human) to view only for so long as is required to create the identity. When the verification is completed, the data is sent back to the user’s own personal device. ([whitepaper](https://www.blockpass.org/downloads/BlockpassWhitepaper.v1.3.2.pdf))
